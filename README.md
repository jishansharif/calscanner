# calscanner
After a year of sitting around the house, the last thing we needed in our lives is a sedentary diet. With the help of Cal Scanner, users can see just how much calorie intake their plate of food it without the tediousness of googling recipes and manually counting calories.

# What it does:
Users can take pictures of their food and drinks and Cal Scanner will detect the amount of calories in each part of your meal (e.g. side of fries, noodles, bowl soup, shot of vodka).

After your big meal, Cal Scanner can also recommend workout activities to do to burn off your target calorie count for the day. Workouts can vary from requiring gym equipment to only needing your body and motivation!
